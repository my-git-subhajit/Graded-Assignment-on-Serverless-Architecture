Q3: Assignment 3: Automated RDS Snapshot Using AWS Lambda and Boto3

Objective: To become familiar with automating RDS tasks using AWS Lambda and Boto3. You will create a Lambda function that takes a snapshot of an RDS instance.

Task: Automate the creation of a snapshot for a specific RDS instance at regular intervals.

Instructions:

1. RDS Setup:

   - Navigate to the RDS dashboard and create a new RDS instance (use the free tier, if available).

   - Note the name of the instance.

2. Lambda IAM Role:

   - In the IAM dashboard, create a new role for Lambda.

   - Attach the `AmazonRDSFullAccess` policy to this role. (Note: Always practice the principle of least privilege in real-world scenarios.)

3. Lambda Function:

   - Navigate to the Lambda dashboard and create a new function.

   - Choose Python 3.x as the runtime.

   - Assign the IAM role created in the previous step.

   - Write the Boto3 Python script to:

     1. Initialize a boto3 RDS client.
     2. Take a snapshot of the specified RDS instance.
     3. Print the snapshot ID for logging purposes.

4. Event Source (Bonus):

   - Attach an event source, like Amazon CloudWatch Events, to trigger the Lambda function every day (or as per your preferred frequency).

5. Manual Invocation:

   - After saving your function, manually trigger it (or wait for the scheduled trigger).

   - Go to the RDS dashboard and confirm that a snapshot has been taken.

Solution:

1. Created an RDS instance with the name `assignment-q3`
2. Make sure that the RDS is in an available state.
3. Navigated to IAM, created a role, and attached `AmazonRDSFullAccess`
4. Created a Lambda Function with Python 3.x and attached the role that was created.
5. Wrote the code using the boto3 module, and https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation
6. Manually tested the function
7. I Also Created a Trigger using `Amazon EventBdridge`
8. Create a schedule with `cron(0 10 * * ? *)` so that it will run everyday at 10.
9. Attached Screenshots
10. Also the code is well documented with comments.
